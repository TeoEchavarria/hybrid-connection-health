# Hybrid Connection Health

A peer-to-peer network monitoring tool that tests and validates hybrid connection health across local area networks (LAN) and wide area networks (WAN). The project uses libp2p to establish connections between peers using multiple discovery mechanisms, including mDNS for local network discovery and Kademlia DHT for distributed peer discovery across the internet.

**Connection types:** TCP transport, mDNS (LAN), Kademlia DHT (WAN).
